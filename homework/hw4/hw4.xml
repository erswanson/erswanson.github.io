                                            Each paper published in the CUSJ undergoes a

                                            Studies at Ravensbourne, with Dr Sara Andersdotter as
                                            its Editor. Corrupted Files is thematic, open access,
                                            and published annually in both online and hardcopy
                                            formats. Its aim is to serve as a platform through which
                                            undergraduate work is shared as research, sitting
                                            alongside the research of more experienced academics and
                                            practitioners. The journal thus plays a crucial part in
                                            a strategic drive towards the support and dissemination
                                            of undergraduate research, and the creation of a more
                                            inclusive research culture.</journal-details>

                                            that all enact some form of writing research from a

      <journal-details>The Measure: A Journal of Undergraduate Research is a
                                            refereed journal dedicated to publishing undergraduate
                                            research from courses in the College of Humanities and
                                            Social Sciences at Sam Houston State University.
                                            Students enrolled in a CHSS course during the academic
                                            year are eligible to submit their work for publication
                                            consideration, whether or not they are majoring in one
                                            of the disciplines in the college. The Measure is guided
                                            by these central principles: undergraduate research is a
                                            vital component of higher education; students enhance
                                            their education when they engage in original research to
                                            make an intellectual contribution to the discipline;
                                            research shared with a broader audience enhances
                                            learning outcomes; and faculty members contribute to
                                            society when they involve undergraduates in research
                                            opportunities.</journal-details>

                                            undergraduates in the Core Curriculum course, University
                                            Writing. Hundreds of students voluntarily submit their
                                            essays to TMR for possible publication and approximately
                                            ten are chosen each year by an editorial advisory board
                                            made up of University Writing instructors. Since these
                                            essays serve as vivid examples of peer work, they are
                                            commonly assigned in University Writing. Students may be
                                            prompted by their instructors to identify the rhetorical
                                            strategies employed in an essay, contemplate their
                                            effectiveness, and attempt to emulate those they admire
                                            in their own work. Thus, Columbia University students
                                            may make their imprint on University Writing long after
                                            they have completed the course.</journal-details>

                                            also with societies and lives around the globe, makes a

      <journal-details>The LSUA Undergraduate Journal of Teaching and Research
                                            (UJTR) is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal designed
                                            to acknowledge the achievements of LSUA undergraduates
                                            in all areas of teaching and research. While
                                            undergraduate teaching and research are the main focus,
                                            research from faculty members is also encouraged for
                                            submission. While we primarily accept publications
                                            within the LSUA community, we also welcome submissions
                                            outside of LSUA.</journal-details>
